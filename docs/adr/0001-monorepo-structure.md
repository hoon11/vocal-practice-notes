# ADR 0001: Monorepo Structure and Backend/Frontend Separation

As the project evolves towards a vocal-training and cloud application, we have established a monorepo structure to segregate the frontend and backend components.

The backend component is first targeted for implementation as the core vocal processing engine. The frontend will be added later as a separate service (pending).
