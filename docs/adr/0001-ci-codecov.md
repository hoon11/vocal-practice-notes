## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed a transparent and robust quality assurance workflow. Without test automation and coverage visibility, long term maintainability and team collaboration would be compromised.

## Decision
- Adopt GitHub Actions for CI (*ci.yml*)
- Run *pytest* for unit test automation
- Upload coverage reports via Codecov GitHub Action
- Add Codecov badge to `backend/README.md`
- Skip `CODECOV_TOKEN` as public repositories work token-free
- Initialize coverage tracking with a baseline PR (empty commit)

## Consequences
- Enforces test-driven development from the CI level
- Establishes visibility into coverage per branch
- Provides groundwork for future minimum threshold enforcement
- Improves onboarding and contribution clarity
